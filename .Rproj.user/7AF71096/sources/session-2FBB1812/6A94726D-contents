Work together with your table-mates to complete the following:

1. Load the "NepalAnthro.rdata" object. From the `nepal.anthro` data frame, create a new data frame that has only the first observation for each child (representing the baseline assessment in the Nepal Anthro study) with complete data on age, height, and weight.
2. Create a scatterplot of weight against age.
    a. Label the axes clearly and make sure that all observations can be seen
    b. Jitter the data or use different levels of transparency as necessary
    c. A smoothed curve allows us to emphasize the relationship between the average weight and age without making a strong parametric assumption, e.g. linearity. Add a smoothed curve (without error bands) for each of the following specifications (create three separate plots):
        i. loess with `span = 0.5`
        ii. a natural spline with 3 degrees of freedom *HINT*: First install and load the `splines()` package, then obtain the natural spline using `geom_smooth(method = "glm", formula = y ~ ns(x, df = 3), se = FALSE)`.
        iii. kernel smoother with bandwidth 20 months. *HINT*: You would need to first sort the data by `age`, `wt`, and `id` then create a new variable using the `ksmooth` function and extract the output, specifically: `ksmooth(age, wt, bandwidth = 20)$y`. Use a `geom_line()` geom with this new variable as the `y` argument within `aes()`.
    d. Describe the relationship between weight and age in 1-2 sentences as if for a journal article. Be as numerate as possible, i.e. your sentences should include numbers!
3. Recreate the plot by using different colors for the plotting symbol for boys and girls.
    a. Choose one of the smoothing functions in #3 to add a smoothed curve separately for boys and girls.
    b. Describe the relationship between weight and age separately by sex in 1-2 sentences as if for a journal article. Be as numerate as possible.
4. Describe how you constructed your figures in 1-2 sentences as if for the methods section of a journal article. When using statistical jargon, explain as plainly as possible.

A sample interpretation would be: *A scatterplot of the relationship between weight and age among a sample of 185 Nepali children showed an increasing trend, with yearly differences in average weight the greatest when comparing 24- to 36-month olds.  Specifically, the average weight among 12-, 24-, 36- and 48-month old children is approximately 7, 9, 12 and 14 kg, respectively.*


```{r answer2, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
## Plot weight against age separately by sex
plot_wt_age_sex <- ggplot(data = nepal_cc, aes(x = age, y = wt, 
                                               color = as.factor(sex))) +

  # Add the color legend specifications

                     values = c("#920045", "#67733C"),
                     labels = c("Male", "Female")) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.1, 0.9),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.key = element_blank())  
plot_wt_age_sex

## For this example, we will use the natural spline smoother
plot_wt_age_sex_ns <- plot_wt_age_sex + 
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", formula = y ~ ns(x, df = 3), se = FALSE,
              linewidth = 1.5)
plot_wt_age_sex_ns
```
A sample interpretation would be: *The scatterplot of the relationship between weight and age among a sample of 185 Nepali children shows an increasing trend that varies by sex of the child. Among 12- to 36-month old children, the increase in mean weight associated with increasing age is similar for both boys and girls although girls on average have lower weights.  After 36-months of age, the increase in mean weight with age is lower among girls compared to boys.*

A sample methods sentence would be: *A scatterplot was used to visualize the correlation between weight and age at baseline among a subsample of 185 Nepali children in the study with complete measurements of age and weight. A smoothed curve based on a natural spline with three degrees of freedom was used to describe the mean (average) weight as a function of age, and the mean functions were created separately for boys and girls.*
